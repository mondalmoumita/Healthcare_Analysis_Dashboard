## Key Visualizations:

- **Average Wait Time:** This visualization displays the average wait time experienced by patients before their appointments. It helps identify potential bottlenecks in the scheduling or service delivery processes.

- **Average Satisfaction Score:** This visualization presents average satisfaction scores provided by patients. It allows healthcare providers to determine overall patient experience and identify areas for improvement.
- **Monthly and Yearly Patient Visits:** Tracking the total number of patient visits each month and year provides insights into seasonal and annual variations in healthcare demand. This helps in resource allocation, capacity planning, and identifying long-term trends.
- **Patients by Weekday and Weekend:** This visualization presents the total number of patient visits categorized by weekdays and weekends.
- **Appointment Type Comparison:** By comparing administrative and non-administrative appointment frequencies, this visualization helps us to distinguish appointments that involve administrative processes and appointments that don't involve administrative processes.
- **Referrals and Walk-In Patients:** This visualization analyzes the balance between patients referred to specific departments and those who walk in without prior referral. It highlights the effectiveness of interdepartmental collaboration and the need for targeted referral strategies.
- **Demographic Breakdown:** Presenting patient visits by age group and race offers insights into healthcare utilization patterns among different demographic segments, facilitating targeted interventions and equitable service delivery.
